# Scroll a tilemap in unity.
 simple solution to scroll a tilemap in unity. 
 
 a lot of forums and videos have tried discussing this one particular problem - Scrolling a tilemap that you created and making a scrolling background type of effect. 
 
simple method of soing this is by creating a script where you move the background ( or tilemap) unitl a point where the background resets to where it started. 

follow this : 
   + open https://github.com/ameed2147/unitytooots/blob/main/bagscr.cs and copy the code.
   +  attach the script to the grid ( not the tilemap ).
   +  click on the main camera to find out the starting and ending points and identify them. ( check images https://github.com/ameed2147/unitytooots/blob/main/example%20values.png and https://github.com/ameed2147/unitytooots/blob/main/locations.png for reference )
   +  click on play.
   +  adjoin multiple grids and attach the same script, change the values accordingly and youve got a scrolling tilemap background.
   +  refer https://github.com/ameed2147/unitytooots/blob/main/scroll%20example.gif .
